The above is a diagram of the Philosophers Stone in Swift SceneKit.   See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle and https://www.philosophersstone.info/ for more info.

Within is a function ``piRadiusSquared()`` that uses pi to calculate a square with the same area as the circle using standard methods.

Then is a function ``squareTheCirce()`` that instead uses the 1.0 perspective of the viewer to calculate the large square's area using rational rather than transcendental math.

And additionally a ratio method is included that uses the ratio of the small square to our large square.
